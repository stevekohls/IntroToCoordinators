# An Introduction to Coordinators
An introduction to the Coordinator pattern in iOS

## Background
This is [a presentation I gave](https://www.meetup.com/CincyCocoaDev/events/srjpjrybchbkb/) at the [Cincinnati CocoaHeads](https://www.meetup.com/CincyCocoaDev/) meetup on 7 May 2020.

The talk covers the basics of how to use the Coordinator pattern in iOS. An Xcode project with the demo code is included, as well as the Keynote slides for the talk. There's lots more room for improvement in both the presentation, and the code. With luck, I'll revisit those later. I'd also like to give a follow-on talk discussion more advanced Coordinator implementations and ideas.

## References
I drew on my own Coordinator implementations, as well as several excellent articles on the subject. If you are interested in using coordinators in your app, I highly recommend reading these articles:
